Gameplay is mostly non-linear, with a mixture of quests, random events, and free-roaming exploration of the world.
It does not provide a mode for single-player offline play, although the developers stated that there would be 
"plenty of content" for online solo play.[9]

The player chooses between ten different races:

Humans: Nords, Redguards, Bretons, and (with separate purchase) Imperials
Elvish races: Dunmer (Dark Elves), Altmer (High Elves), Bosmer (Wood Elves), and Orsimer (Orcs)
Bestial races: Khajiit and Argonians
Players choose one of six classes when creating a character: Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, Templar, 
Warden, or Necromancer. Each class gives the player various different attacks, spells, and passive effects. 
The game has other character choices beyond those of race and class, such as the player character also being 
able to become either a vampire or a werewolf, each of which grants its own skill tree. There are seven 
different crafting skill lines: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Clothier, Enchanting, Woodworking, Provisioning, 
and Jewelry Crafting.
